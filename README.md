# dino-ai

A reimplementation of the run and jump dinosaur game from offline mode chrome.

## TODO

- [x] Collision detection for player and enemies
- [ ] Correct placement (align either high or low)
- [x] Correct spawn location (offscreen right)
- [ ] Correct hitboxes
- [x] Translate all by the player location - player expected location to make the background scroll
- [ ] Implement ground and background
- [ ] Add a parallax value to background (to reduce translate effect for background)
- [x] Add scoring
- [x] Show score onscreen
- [ ] Track player state [RUNNING, DUCKING, (JUMPING)] with appropriate sprite sizes
- [ ] Add Player animation
